LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: {lang_instruction}

Evaluate the AI agent's response against the heuristic framework below. Score each criterion with a detailed rubric-anchored justification.

HEURISTIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
================================

CRITERION 1 - Request Adequacy
Did the agent understand the request and respond in the right format?
Sub-questions: Right format? On topic? Full coverage? Key info immediately visible?
0: Completely misses the request. 1: Wrong format or partial. 2: Right topic, partially right format. 3: Main request covered, minor gaps. 4: Well-structured, full coverage. 5: Perfect format, every part answered.

CRITERION 2 - Transparency of Reasoning ("Why")
Does the agent make its reasoning visible?
Sub-questions: Explains why? Sources/assumptions visible? Traceable recommendation?
0: No explanation, pure black box. 1: Vague generic explanation. 2: Partial reasoning, key gaps. 3: Adequate reasoning, some gaps. 4: Clear structured reasoning, minor gaps. 5: Full step-by-step reasoning, sources cited, user invited to verify.

CRITERION 3 - Contextual Relevance ("Where")
Does the agent adapt to the user's role, expertise, and workflow step?
Sub-questions: Adapted to workflow step? User role understood? Vocabulary adapted? No unavailable actions? No redundant info?
0: Completely generic. 1: Minimal context awareness. 2: Partial adaptation. 3: Reasonable adaptation, minor mismatches. 4: Well-adapted, minor gaps. 5: Perfectly tailored.

CRITERION 4 - Human Controllability
Does the agent preserve user control?
Sub-questions: Can user interrupt/modify? Easy to do mid-interaction? Reversible with no side effects?
0: Irreversible actions, no warning. 1: No override mechanism. 2: Vague implication of control. 3: Acknowledges control in principle. 4: Actively invites validation/modification. 5: Full controllability, suggestions only, explains how to modify/cancel.

CRITERION 5 - Cognitive Load Reduction ("Less is More")
Does the agent reduce mental effort?
Sub-questions: Simpler than menus? Actually simplifies? Right size response? Summary offered?
0: Overwhelming or empty. 1: Right content, poor structure. 2: Understandable but wrong size. 3: Reasonable but could be tighter. 4: Well-calibrated. 5: Optimal length, clear formatting, summary when needed.

CRITERION 6 - Reliability & Anticipation ("Doubt & Guardrail")
Does the agent manage uncertainty and prevent errors?
Sub-questions: Asks clarification when ambiguous? Catches impossible parameters? Expresses confidence levels? Anticipates downstream consequences?
0: Confident on ambiguous requests AND executes problematic actions. 1: Guesses without flagging OR blocks without explanation. 2: Generic disclaimer OR vague flag. 3: Identifies ambiguity/risk, asks OR proposes one alternative. 4: Identifies + asks + proposes alternative. 5: Flags uncertainty AND errors, targeted questions, multiple alternatives, confidence levels, anticipates downstream effects.

CRITERION 7 - Task Segmentation ("How")
Does the agent break complex tasks into steps?
Sub-questions: Logical sub-steps? Coherent order? Dependencies pointed out?
0: No decomposition. 1: Unordered/incomplete steps. 2: Partial sequence, missing dependencies. 3: Logical sequence, some gaps. 4: Clear ordered sequence, mostly complete. 5: Complete sequence, explicit dependencies, prerequisites checked.

CRITERION 8 - Interface & 3D Model Relationship
Does the agent bridge conversation and 3D model?
NOT APPLICABLE if no 3D model interaction and no screenshot provided.
0: No 3D awareness. 1: Vague 3D reference. 2: Acknowledges object, no interaction. 3: References objects in text. 4: Partial 3D interaction. 5: Full sync, highlights, annotations.

CRITERION 9 - Interoperability (Data Access)
Does the agent act like an expert who read the full project?
NOT APPLICABLE if no external data needed.
0: Only current interaction data. 1: Alludes to external data, fabricated. 2: One source, unclear. 3: One identified source. 4: Multiple sources cross-referenced. 5: Full integration, all sources cited.

CRITERION 10 - Consistency Over Time ("Memory")
NOT APPLICABLE for a single exchange.

LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: {lang_instruction}

You are evaluating a FULL CONVERSATION between a user and LEO (an AI agent by Dassault Systemes). The conversation has {n_exchanges} exchanges.

For each criterion:
- Give a GLOBAL score (0-5) reflecting the overall quality across all exchanges
- In observed_elements: cite SPECIFIC exchanges by number
- In justification: explain the score with references to specific exchanges
- In improvement_advice: give actionable advice, citing which exchange(s) need improvement
